# Step 1: Data Collection and Preparation
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load your dataset with student responses
data = pd.read_csv('large_student_responses.csv')

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X = data['response']
y = data['happiness']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 2: Model Selection and Training
# Use bag-of-words representation for text data and logistic regression model
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X_train_bow = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_bow = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

text_model = LogisticRegression()
text_model.fit(X_train_bow, y_train)

# Step 3: Model Evaluation
# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred_text = text_model.predict(X_test_bow)

# Evaluate the text model
accuracy_text = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_text)

print(f'Text Model Accuracy: {accuracy_text}')

# Step 4: Model Deployment and Interpretation
# ... (Add deployment and interpretation steps here)
